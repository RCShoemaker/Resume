\section{Personal Statement}
A dozen years spent in this field has given me both a great wealth of knowledge
and a healthy respect for the complexity and vastness of the technological
landscape of today. Early in my career, I had the good fortune of working with
some individuals who ignited in me a great passion for this field and all its
intricacies. Early on, I was introduced to Linux and instantly became a fan, even
though I \emph{primarily} supported Windows at the time. In all these years, I've had
the opportunity to get my hands on just about every type of technology that you could
imagine. While I thoroughly enjoy imparting the knowledge I have gained, I am, and
will remain, an avid student of this profession.
